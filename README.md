# MediConnect - Hospital Management App

MediConnect is a Flutter-based mobile application for hospital management. It supports patient registration, appointment workflows, and access to medical records. The app integrates with a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) backend to enable standardized healthcare data exchange.

This project is part of a research effort focused on evaluating security and performance when building Flutter apps using official ecosystem packages.

## Overview

The app is designed to support common healthcare workflows:

- Patient onboarding and profile management
- Appointment booking and schedule tracking
- Doctor profile and availability browsing
- Medical record and consultation history viewing
- Secure API-based communication with backend services

## Key Features

### Patient Management

- Register new patients
- View and update patient profiles
- Store demographic and contact information

### Appointment Scheduling

- Book appointments with doctors
- View upcoming and past appointments
- Reschedule or cancel appointments

### Doctor Information

- View doctor profiles
- Access specialization and department details
- Check consultation availability

### Medical Records Viewer

- View consultation history
- Display observations and encounter details
- Access prescription information

### Notifications and Reminders

- Appointment reminders
- Health record update notifications

### Secure Data Access

- Authentication for authorized users
- Secure communication with backend APIs

## System Architecture

MediConnect follows a layered architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**  
	Flutter mobile client for UI and app-side logic.
2. **Integration Layer**  
	RESTful API communication using FHIR-aligned resources.
3. **Backend Layer**  
	HAPI FHIR server for healthcare resource management.
4. **Data Layer**  
	PostgreSQL storage for structured FHIR-compliant data.

## Technology Stack

The application uses official Flutter ecosystem packages where possible for long-term support, security, and maintainability.

| Feature | Package 0 |
|---|---|
| State management | `ChangeNotifier`, `InheritedWidget` |
| API communication | `http` |
| Navigation | `go_router` |
| Local storage | `path_provider` |
| Local database | `sqflite` |
| Notifications | Native platform channels |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (stable channel)
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter tooling
- A running backend FHIR server (if testing live integration)

### Installation

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk

# iOS (macOS only)
flutter build ios

# Web
flutter build web
```

## Project Structure

  domain/        # Domain models and services
  presentation/  # Screens, state management, and UI widgets

```

## Research Context

This codebase supports a research study comparing official and third-party Flutter plugin usage, with an emphasis on:

- Security exposure
- Performance impact
- Maintainability and long-term stability

## FHIR Integration Environment Setup

Use these steps to prepare local development for FHIR server integration.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Run app with FHIR configuration

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=FHIR_BASE_URL=https://your-fhir-server/fhir \
  --dart-define=FHIR_AUTH_BASE_URL=https://your-auth-server \
  --dart-define=FHIR_CLIENT_ID=medi-connect-mobile \
  --dart-define=FHIR_REDIRECT_URI=com.medi.connect://oauth-callback \
  --dart-define=FHIR_SCOPE="openid profile offline_access patient/*.read" \
  --dart-define=FHIR_USE_HTTPS=true
```

### 3. Verify environment keys

`FhirEnvironment` in `lib/core/config/fhir_environment.dart` exposes:

- `isConfigured`
- `missingKeys`

Use these before enabling production authentication logic.

### 4. Available FHIR scaffolding

- `lib/core/network/fhir_http_client.dart`
- `lib/data/datasources/auth_secure_token_datasource.dart`
- `lib/data/datasources/fhir/fhir_metadata_remote_datasource.dart`
- `lib/data/datasources/fhir/fhir_patient_remote_datasource.dart`

### 5. Next milestone

Implement SMART on FHIR OAuth2 PKCE login and inject the resulting access token
into `FhirHttpClient`.
